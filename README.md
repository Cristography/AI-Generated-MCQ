# AI Generated MCQ 🎉

Hello everyone!

I am excited to share a new project I worked on to help us all study and prepare for exams.

## 📚✨ Project Name
**AI Generated MCQ**

## 🔍 What is this site?

A free training platform containing multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering topics from various university subjects.

- Select the subject you want to review.
- Start the test.
- After each question, an explanation appears immediately to help you understand the correct answer.

## 🤖 What makes this project unique?

All questions and content (including parts of the site design) were created with the help of AI tools.

The goal is to explore how AI can enhance our learning experience, turning lectures into an interactive and effective training tool.

## 💾 Additional Features

- Saves your answers locally in the browser to track your progress.
- Easily clear data to retake exercises.
- "Report an error" option next to each question sends feedback via Telegram for correction.

## ⚠️ Important Notes Before Use

- This is a Beta version and may contain bugs or technical issues.
- The content is unofficial and may have phrasing or factual errors.  
  Use the platform only as an auxiliary tool, and do not replace official sources and lectures.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The project is completely free and aims to help you study and practice.

It started as a personal idea, and I decided to share it for public benefit.
